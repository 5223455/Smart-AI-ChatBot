# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |

| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do NOT create a public issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent exploitation.

### 2. Email us directly
Send details to: security@yourdomain.com

### 3. Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information

### 4. Response timeline:
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on complexity)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Keep Ollama updated to the latest version
- Use strong, unique passwords for any authentication
- Regularly update Node.js and Python dependencies
- Run the application in a secure environment
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity

### For Developers
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement proper error handling
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use environment variables for sensitive data

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **Local Processing**: All AI processing happens locally with Ollama
- **No Data Collection**: We don't collect or store user conversations
- **File Uploads**: Uploaded files are processed locally and can be deleted
- **Session Data**: Chat history is stored in memory only

### Network Security
- **Local Server**: Runs on localhost by default
- **CORS**: Configured for local development
- **No External APIs**: All AI processing is local

### File Security
- **Upload Validation**: File types and sizes are validated
- **Temporary Storage**: Uploaded files are stored temporarily
- **Cleanup**: Files are automatically cleaned up

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. File Upload
- **Risk**: Malicious file uploads
- **Mitigation**: File type validation, size limits, temporary storage
- **Recommendation**: Only upload trusted files

### 2. Speech Recognition
- **Risk**: Audio data sent to browser's speech recognition service
- **Mitigation**: Uses browser's built-in Web Speech API
- **Recommendation**: Be aware of browser's privacy policy

### 3. Local AI Models
- **Risk**: AI model vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: Use trusted Ollama models, keep updated
- **Recommendation**: Regularly update Ollama and models

### 4. Network Exposure
- **Risk**: Server exposed to network
- **Mitigation**: Default localhost binding
- **Recommendation**: Don't expose to public networks without proper security

## Security Updates

We regularly update dependencies and address security issues:

- **Dependencies**: Updated monthly or as needed
- **Security Patches**: Applied immediately when available
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular automated scans
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed for security implications

## Reporting Security Issues

1. **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., XSS, CSRF, Injection)
2. **Affected Component**: (e.g., frontend, backend, API)
3. **Severity**: (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
4. **Proof of Concept**: Steps to reproduce
5. **Impact**: Potential damage or data exposure
